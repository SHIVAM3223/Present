      <h1>Mercury</h1>
      <p>
        Ancient Wisdom: My love carries within her the wisdom of the ages. Just
        as Mercury was known to ancient civilizations, her soul is rich with
        knowledge and experience. She understands the world in a way that is
        both deep and mysterious, much like the hidden secrets of the universe.
      </p>
      <img src="Project3/Mercury.jpg" />
      <h2>Her Timeless Beauty</h2>
      <p>
        A year with her feels like a moment, yet also an eternity. Like
        Mercury's 88-day year, time seems to slow down and speed up all at once
        when I'm with her. Every moment is precious, filled with the intensity
        of a love that knows no bounds.
      </p>
      <h2>Petite yet Powerful</h2>
      <p>
        She may be small in stature, but like Mercury, she is the second densest
        being in my universe. Her presence is felt deeply; every glance, every
        touch is powerful and leaves a lasting impression on my heart.
      </p>
      <h2>Her Unique Marks</h2>
      <p>
        Just as Mercury's surface has wrinkles, her uniqueness is in the little
        imperfections that make her perfect. Every laugh line, every freckle is
        a story of a moment we've shared, a memory etched into the fabric of our
        love.

        Venus has captivated astronomers for centuries.
      </p>
      <p>
        My love for her is constant, appearing at both dawn and dusk, like Venus
        as the morning and evening star. She brings light to my life,
        illuminating even the darkest moments. Though others may see challenges,
        I see only the warmth of her love, transforming any environment into
        paradise.

      <img src="Project3/Venus.jpg" />
      <h2>Our love transcends time.</h2>
      <p>
        In the vastness of our love, time loses meaning. A single day with her
        feels like an eternity of bliss, while years pass like moments. Our bond
        defies conventional measures, creating its own rhythm in the universe of
        our affection.
      </p>
      <h2>Our love challenges conventions.</h2>
      <p>
        Like Venus' unique rotation, our love doesn't follow the usual paths.
        We've created our own direction, spinning together in a dance that may
        seem unconventional to others but feels perfectly natural to us. Our
        relationship needs no external validation; we are complete in ourselves.
      </p>
      <h2>Her love illuminates my world.</h2>
      <p>
        Her love shines so brightly that it outshines all else in my life. Even
        in broad daylight, the radiance of her affection is visible to me,
        guiding my path and warming my heart.
      </p>
      <h2>The depth of our love is immeasurable.</h2>
      <p>
        The intensity of our love is beyond compare. It withstands any pressure,
        growing stronger with each challenge. In the vast ocean of life, our
        love provides a constant, comforting presence, supporting us through
        every depth and height we encounter together.
      </p>

        keeps me on my toes, always surprising me with her spontaneity and zest

        warm, loving, and full of passion. Like the ice giant Uranus, with its
        frozen outer layers concealing a dynamic core, her calm demeanor masks a

        how Neptune's existence was calculated before it was observed. The
        irregularities in my life's orbit led me to her, and when I finally saw
        her, it was as if all the mathematical predictions of my heart had come
